## Colour Correction

This app simply displays information about skin tone colours and thus can be used with any external editing application. It does not provide any colour correction abilities itself.

Use cases:
- Determine whether skin tones have the correct hue, saturation, and brightness.
- Correct a photo's white balance via skin tones instead of using a neutral grey colour.
- Useful for colour blind users who cannot see subtle skin tone differences.

Use your editing program of choice to fix incorrect tones as follows:
- Adjust the tint of a photo to fix the skin tone hue.
- Adjust the warmth, saturation, or vibrance to fix the skin tone saturation.
- Adjust the exposure or tone controls to fix the skin tone brightness.
- Use global or local adjustments as needed to correct skin tones of each person individually.

**Disclaimer**

- This tool should be used as a guide and does not necessarily dictate the best skin tone in every use case.
- Photos taken under harsh or coloured light will not always look good when adjusted using this tool.
- Stylistic choices resulting in 'wrong' hue, saturation, or brightness levels are valid and can still result in good photos.
- This tool simply helps to inform your editing decisions, but ultimately you should edit your photo as you wish.
